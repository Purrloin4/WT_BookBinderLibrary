            <h1>Welcome to our Software-engineering and Web technology project</h1>
            <p>
                This website is made for a course we followed called: "Software-engineering and Web technology".
                Each team of 5 students had to work together to make a website about the "BookBinder" concept seen in other courses.
            </p>
            <h2>Our implementation</h2>
            <p>
                Our vision was to create an environment to aid people interested in reading to find like-minded readers and discuss
                book, characters and authors.<br><br>

                To achieve this we provide these features:<br>
                - User authentication<br>
                - Friendships<br>
                - Messaging<br>
                - Commenting<br>
                - Subscribing<br>
            </p>
            <h2>The team</h2>
            <p>
                Our team of 5 students consisted out of:<br>
                Sinyeol, scrum master/project manager<br>
                Zeus, database engineer<br>
                Wentai, backend developer<br>
                Dries, frontend developer<br>
                CÃ©dric, deployment/CI engineer<br>
            </p>
